        <p>Dear Baby,</p>
        <p>Happy 25th birthday, my love!</p>
        <p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost two years since that unforgettable night we met at the bar. I can still picture it—the moment our eyes met, and I just knew there was something special about you. I had no idea then that I was about to meet someone who would change my life in the most beautiful way.</p>
        <p>Being with you has been like living in a dream. You bring so much enthusiasm and joy into my life, and you treat me like the queen I always knew I was meant to be. Every day with you is a new adventure, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</p>
        <p>As you turn 25, I want you to know how grateful I am to have you by my side. You make everything brighter, and I’m so excited for all the amazing things we have ahead of us.</p>
        <p>I wish I could be there with you today, but I hope this little surprise brings a smile to your face and reminds you just how much you mean to me.</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, Azar! Here’s to many more birthdays together, and a lifetime of love and happiness.</p>
        <p>With all my love,</p>
        <p>Khulud</p>
