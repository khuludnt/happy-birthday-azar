        <h1>Happy Birthday, Azar!</h1>
        <p>Dear Baby,</p>
        <p>Happy 25th birthday, my love!</p>
        <p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost two years since that unforgettable night we met at the bar. I can still picture it—the moment our eyes met, and I just knew there was something special about you. I had no idea then that I was about to meet someone who would change my life in the most beautiful way.</p>
        <p>Being with you has been like living in a dream. You bring so much enthusiasm and joy into my life, and you treat me like the queen I always knew I was meant to be. Every day with you is a new adventure, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</p>
        <p>As you turn 25, I want you to know how grateful I am to have you by my side. You make everything brighter, and I’m so excited for all the amazing things we have ahead of us.</p>
        <p>I know we fight a lot and I may come off as harsh, but God knows how much I love you. I cannot imagine my life without you.</p>
        <p>I want you to know how much I love you and how proud I am to be your girlfriend. It’s amazing how something unexpected can become one of the most precious things in your life. At first, I thought it would be incredibly difficult for us to maintain a serious relationship. I didn’t know we could make it work. But in reality, with you, I forget all my sorrows and worries. With you, it’s like paradise; you make me feel like a child on her birthday—smiling and happy.</p>
        <p>I’m attached to you in an incredible way, and it’s beautiful because I never thought I would find my soulmate. Every day, I fall in love with you again, as if it were the first day.</p>
        <p>I hate that you are far from me. Being apart from you feels like torture. I miss you—your eyes, your lips, your smile, your hugs. I want you by my side every hour of every day because you are my reason for living and my reason for smiling.</p>
        <p>You are beautiful and perfect. If I had the chance to describe you, I would say you are the most perfect man.</p>
        <p>In short, I love you and I look forward to the day we can say "I do" on our special day.</p>
        <p>Thank you for everything, my most precious love. I adore you and I’m sending you thousands and thousands of kisses <333</p>
        <p>With all my love,</p>
        <p>Khulud</p>
